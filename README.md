## üí¨ Stuff You Can Ask Me About

There's much I'm still learning, but I might be able to help if you need assistance with implementing full-stack projects that follow the [Jamstack (Next.js + Directus)](https://jamstack.org) pattern.

Or if you just need general debugging/troubleshooting help with something tech-related (remote assistance through something like AnyDesk is an option).

  - 2D vector art

Mainly playing around with automation techniques and procedural generation since I lack a traditional art background.
Still leanring the essentials of perspective for 2D art, good topology for 3D (animated) art, and anatomy for both.

No plans to get into traditional 2D drawing or 3D sculpting anytime soon.
